Shooting  Yourself  in  the  Foot	The proliferation of modern programming languages (all of which seem tohave stolen countless features from each other) sometimes makes itdifficult to remember what language you're currently using.  This guideis offered as a public service to help programmers who find themselves insuch a dilemma.C:  You shoot yourself in the foot.C++:  You accidentally create a dozen instances of yourself and shootthem all in the foot.  Providing emergency medical assistance isimpossible since you can't tell which are the bitwise copies and whichare just pointing at others and saying, "That's me, over there."FORTRAN:  You shoot yourself in each toe, iteratively, until you run outof toes, then you read in the next foot and repeat.  If you run out ofbullets, you continue anyway because you have no exception handlingability.Modula-2:  After realizing that you can't actually accomplish anything inthis language, you shoot yourself in the head.COBOL:  USEing a COLT45HANDGUN, AIM gun atLEG.FOOT, THEN placeARM.HAND.FINGER onHAND.GUN.TRIGGER andSQUEEZE.  THEN returnHANDGUN to HOLSTER.  CHECKwhether shoelace needs to be retied.LISP:  You shoot yourself in theappendage which holds the gun withwhich you shoot yourself in the appendage which holds the gun withwhich you shoot yourself in the appendage which holds the gun withwhich you shoot yourself in theappendage which holds the gun withwhich you . . .BASIC:  Shoot yourself in the foot with a water pistol.  On big systemscontinue until entire lower body is waterlogged.Concurrent Euclid:You shoot yourself in somebody else's foot.FORTH:  Foot in yourself shootAPL:  You shoot yourself in the foot, then spend all day trying to figureout how to do it in fewer characters.APL: you hear a loud noise and a hole appears suddenly in your     foot, but you are unable to figure out what happened.APL: you hear a gunshot, and there is a hole in your foot, butyou do not remember enough linear algebra to understand what thehell happened.Pascal:  The compiler won't let you shoot yourself in the foot.Python:You try to shoot yourself in the foot but you just keep hitting the whitespace between your toes.Perl:You shoot yourself in the foot, but nobody can understand how you did it. Six months later, neither can you.JavaScript:You've perfected a robust, rich user experience for shooting yourself in the foot. You then find that bullets are disabled on your gun.FTP:ftp> cd /footftp> put bulletsUnix:foot.c foot.h foot.o toe.c toe.orm: .o: No such file or directorySQL:SELECT @ammo:=bullet FROM gun WHERE trigger = 'PULLED';INSERT INTO leg (foot) VALUES (@ammo);Visual Basic:  You'll shoot yourself in the foot, but you'll have so muchfun doing it that you won't care.Prolog:  You tell your program you want to be shot in the foot.  Theprogram figures out how to do it, but the syntax doesn't allow it toexplain.370 JCL:  You send your foot down to MIS with a 4000-page documentexplaining how you want it to be shot.  Three years later, your footcomes back deep-fried.Mathematica: You try to shoot yourself in the foot and then have tofigure out why it didn't work.Macsyma: You shoot yourself in the foot, but the hole appears in yourhead.  You spend the rest of the day trying variations on optionvariables, until you stumble upon  SHOOTFOOTMODE:True$ and  SHOOTFOOTMODEWHICH:RIGHT$... Which are of course documented, but you couldnt find it until youknew the answer. :> Maple:  You spend a whole day writing and refining a 'shoot yourself in        the foot' function, use it, and then find out from a colleague	that it's already implemented, in the 'student' package.Maple: A ShootFoot function was not implemented in Release n, but will beincluded in Release n+1. Meanwhile, you may purchase Release n at theRelease n+1 price (multiply the Release n price by 2.2, or by 3.7 outsideNorth America.)Axiom:  You pull the trigger,           you see a blinding light,                     you hear a deafening noise,                               no hole in foot ......yet!but after quite a while you do get a sensible answer of                           Type: Stream Blood From Right Lower Limb
